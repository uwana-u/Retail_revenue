Optimizing online sports retail revenue

**The dataset used in this project was provided by DataCamp.**

In this project I took on the role of a product analyst. I analyzed the product data of an online sports store to improve their revenue and also provide recommendations for the marketing and sales team.
I had to deal with missing data as well as numeric, string and timestamps to draw insights about the products in the store. 
The following are questions that were answered through the analysis of the data:
* How do the price points of each brand's product differ?
  * Which brand generated more revenue?
  * Where discounts offered on the products? What is the average discount by brand
* Is there any correlation between revenue and reviews?
  * Is there any trends or gaps that could be exploited?
* Is there any correlation between rating/reviews and product description length?
  * Is there any trends or gaps that could be exploited?
  
## Dataset
This dataset contained five tables with the product_id being the primary key for all of them.
* Info
* Finance 
* Reviews
* Traffic
* Brands
